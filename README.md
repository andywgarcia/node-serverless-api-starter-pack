# node-serverless-api-starter-pack

Common pattern that I use for starting new serverless APIs

Comes with:

- Extracted logging module
- Hello world lambda triggered by API Gateway
- Lambda wrapper that will allow for async/await usage
- Lambda wrapper that will make it easier to do error handling
